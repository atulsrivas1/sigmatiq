## üöÄ Overview

Sigmatiq is an institutional-grade, retail-first platform that transforms market data and AI models into actionable trading signals, safe practice environments, and automated execution capabilities. Built to level the playing field for retail traders, Sigmatiq provides transparent, evidence-based trading tools with enterprise-level risk controls.

### Core Philosophy
- **Evidence over opinion** - All signals carry provenance, assumptions, and expected ranges
- **Transparency first** - Model cards, data sheets, and post-trade attribution are standard
- **Risk-aware by default** - Conservative controls enabled by default; users must opt into higher risk
- **Human control** - Automation is reversible and bounded by user policies
- **Continuous learning** - Every trade feeds evaluation loops and improves models
