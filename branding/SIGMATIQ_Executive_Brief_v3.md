# SIGMATIQ Executive Brief v3
**Intelligence You Can Trust**

---

## What we do
Transparent AI for market intelligence. Every output is explainable and auditable, so decisions can be verified and governed.

## The problem
- Retail tools are either simplistic filters or opaque “black‑box” AI.  
- Signal feeds lack testing. Research and execution are disconnected.  
- Users must choose between risky live trading or weak paper tests.

## The solution: The Sigma Suite
- **SigmaLab** — build and use AI models without code.  
  - **Scanner Models**: market‑wide discovery across thousands of tickers.  
  - **Signal Models**: ticker‑level entry/exit alerts with rationale.
- **SigmaSim** — universal paper trading to validate any model with real‑time data.  
- **SigmaMarket** — coming marketplace to share and monetize proven models.  
- **SigmaPilot** — planned automated execution with built‑in risk controls.  
- **SigmaCore** — shared data, backtesting, and governance infrastructure.

## How it works
Two‑layer intelligence: Scanners surface opportunities, then Signals analyze and act. Chain them into a complete workflow with full transparency and performance tracking.

## Why we win
- End‑to‑end journey in one platform: **Create → Test → Share → Execute**.  
- Radical transparency: explainability, audit trails, and measurable outcomes.  
- Visual no‑code builder lowers the barrier while preserving rigor.  
- Governance and paper‑first discipline reduce model‑risk and hype.  
- Network effects: better models → stronger marketplace → more users.

## Target users
Active traders and systematic investors, advisors and analysts, trading educators, small funds and family offices.

## Business model
Freemium SaaS plus marketplace revenue share. Future enterprise and API plans.

## Roadmap
- **Now**: Launch SigmaLab with pre‑trained models and SigmaSim testing.  
- **+6 months**: Open SigmaMarket with community features.
