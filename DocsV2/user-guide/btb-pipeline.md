# The Build-Train-Backtest (BTB) Pipeline

## Your Complete Guide to Strategy Development

The BTB Pipeline is the heart of Sigmatiq - a systematic approach to creating, validating, and deploying trading strategies. Think of it as your strategy factory, turning ideas into validated, tradeable models.

## Understanding the Pipeline

### Why BTB?

Traditional trading often relies on:
- Gut feelings and hunches
- Incomplete testing
- Emotional decision-making
- Anecdotal evidence

The BTB Pipeline replaces this with:
- Data-driven decisions
- Comprehensive validation
- Systematic execution
- Statistical confidence

### The Three Stages Explained

#### 1. BUILD - Prepare Your Data üî®

**What Happens**: Sigmatiq collects and organizes historical market data into a training matrix.

**Think of it like**: Gathering ingredients before cooking
- Stock prices (the main ingredient)
- Technical indicators (the spices)
- Market conditions (the cooking temperature)

**What You Control**:
- Date range for historical data
- Which indicators to include
- Data quality thresholds

**Output**: A training matrix (structured dataset)

#### 2. TRAIN - Create Your Model üéØ

**What Happens**: Machine learning algorithms learn patterns from your training data.

**Think of it like**: Teaching someone to recognize patterns
- Show examples of good trades
- Show examples of bad trades
- Let them learn the differences

**What You Control**:
- Algorithm type (usually XGBoost)
- Training parameters
- Validation splits

**Output**: A trained model (pattern recognizer)

#### 3. BACKTEST - Validate Performance üìà

**What Happens**: Test your model on historical data to see how it would have performed.

**Think of it like**: Taking practice exams before the real test
- Apply model to past data
- Simulate trades
- Calculate performance

**What You Control**:
- Test period
- Trading costs/slippage
- Position sizing

**Output**: Performance report with metrics

## Detailed Walkthrough

### Stage 1: BUILD - Data Preparation

#### Step 1: Select Your Model
Navigate to Models ‚Üí Select your model ‚Üí Click Composer ‚Üí Build tab

#### Step 2: Configure Date Range

**Training Period Selection**:
- **Minimum**: 1 year (250 trading days)
- **Recommended**: 2-3 years
- **Maximum**: 5 years

**Considerations**:
- **Recent data** (1-2 years): Captures current market regime
- **Longer data** (3-5 years): Includes various market conditions
- **Very old data** (5+ years): May not reflect current markets

**Example Settings**:
```
Start Date: 2022-01-01
End Date: 2023-12-31
Result: 2 years, ~500 trading days
```

#### Step 3: Review Indicators

Your model template includes pre-selected indicators. Common ones:

**Trend Indicators**:
- Moving Averages (20, 50, 200-day)
- MACD (trend strength)
- ADX (trend quality)

**Momentum Indicators**:
- RSI (overbought/oversold)
- Stochastic (momentum shifts)
- Rate of Change

**Volatility Indicators**:
- ATR (average true range)
- Bollinger Bands
- Standard Deviation

**Volume Indicators**:
- Volume Moving Average
- On-Balance Volume
- Volume Rate of Change

#### Step 4: Build the Matrix

Click "Build Matrix" and monitor:

**Progress Indicators**:

**Quality Metrics**:
```
Rows: 504 (trading days)
Features: 23 (indicators + price)
Missing Data: 0.1% (excellent)
Matrix SHA: 7f3a2b1 (unique identifier)
```

#### Step 5: Verify Matrix Quality

**Green Flags** ‚úÖ:
- Complete data (>99%)
- Sufficient rows (>250)
- Balanced features (10-50)
- No corrupted values

**Red Flags** ‚ùå:
- Missing data (>5%)
- Too few rows (<100)
- Too many features (>100, overfitting risk)
- Data errors

### Stage 2: TRAIN - Model Creation

#### Step 1: Configure Training Parameters

**Algorithm Selection** (usually automatic):

- **Random Forest**: Good for simple patterns
- **Neural Network**: Complex patterns (advanced)

**Training/Validation Split**:
- **80/20 Split**: Standard approach
- 80% data for learning
- 20% for validation

**Cross-Validation**:
- **5-Fold**: Recommended
- Tests model robustness
- Prevents overfitting

#### Step 2: Set Trading Constraints

**Allowed Trading Hours**:
```
Market Hours: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET
Pre-Market: 4:00 AM - 9:30 AM ET (optional)
After-Hours: 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM ET (optional)
```

**Position Constraints**:
- Maximum positions: 5-10
- Position size: 10-20% each
- Stop loss: 2-5%

#### Step 3: Start Training

Click "Train Model" and observe:

**Training Phases**:

```

#### Step 4: Understand Training Results

**Good Training Results**:
- Train/Validation accuracy similar (within 5%)
- Accuracy 55-75% (realistic)
- Clear feature importance
- Stable learning curve

**Warning Signs**:
- Train accuracy much higher than validation (overfitting)
- Accuracy >85% (too good to be true)
- Single dominant feature (over-reliance)
- Erratic learning curve

### Stage 3: BACKTEST - Performance Validation

#### Step 1: Configure Backtest

**Test Period**:
- **Out-of-Sample**: Data not used in training
- **Recent Period**: Last 6-12 months
- **Special Events**: Include market stress periods

**Trading Assumptions**:
```
Starting Capital: $10,000
Commission: $1 per trade
Slippage: 0.1% (realistic)
Spread: Bid-Ask included
```

#### Step 2: Run Backtest

Click "Run Backtest" and watch:

**Simulation Steps**:
1. **Initialize Portfolio** (instant)
2. **Generate Signals** (30 seconds)
3. **Execute Trades** (1 minute)
4. **Calculate Metrics** (30 seconds)
5. **Generate Report** (instant)

**Real-Time Display**:

- Trade exits (red arrows)
- Equity curve building
- Drawdown periods

#### Step 3: Analyze Results

**Core Metrics**:

**Sharpe Ratio** (Risk-Adjusted Return):

- Account for inflation

**Win Rate**:
- 45-55%: Typical trend following
- 55-65%: Good balance
- 65-75%: Mean reversion
- Above 75%: Verify for realism

**Maximum Drawdown**:
- Under 10%: Conservative
- 10-20%: Moderate
- 20-30%: Aggressive
- Over 30%: High risk

**Trade Statistics**:
```
Total Trades: 52
Winning Trades: 31 (59.6%)
Losing Trades: 21 (40.4%)
Average Win: +2.3%
Average Loss: -1.1%
Largest Win: +5.8%
Largest Loss: -2.2% (stopped out)
Average Hold Time: 4.2 days
```

#### Step 4: Review Detailed Reports

**Equity Curve Analysis**:
- Smooth upward trend (ideal)
- Volatile but profitable (acceptable)
- Flat or declining (needs work)

**Monthly Returns Table**:
```
       Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun
2023  +2.1% -0.5% +3.2% +1.8% -1.2% +2.5%

```

**Trade Distribution**:
- Bell curve centered above zero (good)
- Long tail of winners (trend following)
- Tight distribution (consistent)

## Advanced BTB Techniques

- Indicator periods (fast, medium, slow)

**Sweep Results**:
```
Config #1: Threshold=0.5, Hours=Full, Sharpe=1.2
Config #2: Threshold=0.6, Hours=Morning, Sharpe=1.8 ‚≠ê
Config #3: Threshold=0.7, Hours=Full, Sharpe=0.9
```
