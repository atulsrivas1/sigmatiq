In this guide, we'll cover:
1. Setting up your account
2. Understanding the dashboard
3. Choosing your risk profile
4. Creating your first trading model
5. Running your first backtest
6. Understanding results

## Before You Begin

## Understanding Sigmatiq's Approach

Sigmatiq uses a systematic approach to trading that removes emotion and guesswork:

### The Build-Train-Backtest (BTB) Pipeline

Think of it like training an athlete:
1. **Build** - Design the training program (create your trading strategy)
2. **Train** - Practice the techniques (teach the model using historical data)
3. **Backtest** - Measure performance (test how well it would have worked)

This approach ensures every trading decision is based on data, not hunches.

## Your First Login

When you first access Sigmatiq, you'll see:

### The Dashboard
Your command center showing:
- **Recent Models** - Your trading strategies at a glance
- **Last Runs** - Recent backtest results

## Choosing Your Risk Profile

Before creating your first model, you'll select a risk profile. This is like choosing the difficulty level in a game:

### üõ°Ô∏è Conservative (Recommended for Beginners)
- **What it means**: Prioritize capital preservation
- **Trade frequency**: Fewer, higher-confidence trades
- **Drawdown limits**: Strict (max 5-8% loss)
- **Position sizes**: Smaller (1-2% per trade)
- **Best for**: New users, risk-averse investors

### ‚öñÔ∏è Balanced (Default Setting)
- **What it means**: Balance growth with protection
- **Trade frequency**: Moderate number of trades
- **Drawdown limits**: Moderate (max 10-15% loss)
- **Position sizes**: Standard (2-5% per trade)
- **Best for**: Most users, steady growth seekers

### üöÄ Aggressive (Experienced Users)
- **What it means**: Maximize returns, accept higher risk
- **Trade frequency**: More trades, lower thresholds
- **Drawdown limits**: Flexible (max 20-25% loss)
- **Position sizes**: Larger (5-10% per trade)
- **Best for**: Experienced traders, high risk tolerance

You can change your risk profile anytime, and different models can use different profiles.

## Creating Your First Model

### Step 1: Choose a Template

Click "Create Model" and you'll see strategy templates:

**For Your First Model, We Recommend:**
- **SPY Swing Trading** - Trade the S&P 500 ETF over 2-10 days
- **Simple Momentum** - Follow strong trends in major stocks
- **Mean Reversion** - Buy oversold, sell overbought conditions

Each template includes:
- Pre-selected indicators
- Tested parameters
- Appropriate risk settings

### Step 2: Name Your Model

Choose a descriptive name like:
- "My First Swing Strategy"
- "Test SPY Momentum"
- "Learning Model 1"

The name helps you track multiple strategies later.

### Step 3: Review Settings

The template provides good defaults, but you can see:
- **Indicators** - Technical analysis tools (RSI, Moving Averages, etc.)
- **Time Frame** - How often to check for signals
- **Asset Type** - Stocks or options
- **Risk Controls** - Stop losses and position limits

Don't worry about changing these yet - templates are pre-optimized.

## Running Your First Backtest

### What is a Backtest?

A backtest is like a time machine - it shows how your strategy would have performed if you had traded it in the past. This helps validate ideas before risking real money.

### Starting the Backtest

1. Click on your new model
2. Go to the "Composer" tab
3. Select "Build" to prepare historical data
4. Choose your date range (we recommend 2 years)
5. Click "Run Backtest"

### Understanding the Progress

You'll see:
- **Building Matrix** - Gathering historical data
- **Training Model** - Learning patterns
- **Running Simulation** - Testing trades
- **Generating Report** - Creating results

This typically takes 2-5 minutes.

## Understanding Your Results

### Key Metrics Explained

When your backtest completes, you'll see:

#### Sharpe Ratio (Risk-Adjusted Returns)
- **What it means**: Return per unit of risk
- **Good**: Above 1.0
- **Excellent**: Above 2.0
- **Poor**: Below 0.5

#### Total Return
- **What it means**: How much money you would have made
- **Example**: 15% means $10,000 becomes $11,500

#### Win Rate
- **What it means**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Good**: Above 55%
- **Note**: High win rate doesn't always mean profitable

#### Maximum Drawdown
- **What it means**: Largest peak-to-valley loss
- **Acceptable**: Under 15%
- **Concerning**: Over 25%

#### Number of Trades
- **What it means**: How active the strategy is
- **Minimum**: 30+ for statistical significance

### The Gate System

Sigmatiq automatically evaluates results:

‚úÖ **Pass Gate** - Strategy meets quality standards:
- Sufficient trades
- Acceptable risk metrics
- Positive performance

‚ùå **Fail Gate** - Strategy needs work:
- Too few trades
- Excessive drawdown
- Poor risk-adjusted returns

Only "Pass Gate" strategies should be considered for real trading.

## Common Questions

### "How much money do I need?"
Start with paper trading (free). When ready for real trading, $1,000-$5,000 is typical, though you can start smaller.

### "How long before I see results?"
- Backtests: Immediate (2-5 minutes)
- Paper trading: 1-2 weeks for meaningful data
- Real trading: 1-3 months for statistical significance

### "What if my first model fails?"
This is normal and expected! Most professional traders test dozens of strategies. Each "failure" teaches you what doesn't work.

### "Should I trust the backtest results?"
Backtests are helpful but imperfect. They assume:
- You could have executed at shown prices
- Market conditions remain similar
- No significant slippage

Always paper trade before using real money.
