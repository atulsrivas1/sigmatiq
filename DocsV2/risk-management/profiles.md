# Understanding Risk Profiles

## Your Safety Settings for Smarter Trading

Risk profiles in Sigmatiq are like safety settings on a car - they control how fast you go, when you brake, and what roads you can take. This guide explains everything you need to know about choosing and using risk profiles effectively.

## What Are Risk Profiles?

Risk profiles are pre-configured sets of safety rules that govern:
- How much money you risk per trade
- When to exit losing positions
- How many trades to make
- What quality of signals to accept

Think of them as guardrails that keep your trading within safe boundaries.

## The Three Risk Profiles

### 🛡️ Conservative Profile - "Safety First"

**Philosophy**: Protect capital above all else. Better to miss opportunities than lose money.

#### Key Settings

**Position Sizing**:
- Maximum 2% of capital per trade
- Never more than 10% total exposure
- Example: $10,000 account = $200 max per trade

**Stop Losses**:
- Tight stops at 2% loss
- Time stops after 5 days
- Trailing stops lock in profits

**Signal Quality**:
- Only high-confidence signals (>70%)
- Minimum 50 historical examples
- Must pass all quality gates

**Trade Frequency**:
- 2-5 trades per week
- Maximum 3 open positions
- No overnight holds on Fridays

#### When to Use Conservative

**Perfect for**:
- New traders
