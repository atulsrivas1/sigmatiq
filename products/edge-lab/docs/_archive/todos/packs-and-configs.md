Packs & Model Configs

Completed
- ZeroEdge pack includes model configs and extended indicator set; policies enforced (YAML).
- Model creation script guarantees per-model policy exists; Makefile init/init-auto targets.
- Pack selection is explicit via `pack_id` in API and Makefile.

Pending
- Scaffold `swingedge`/`longedge` with minimal indicator sets, default policies, and example configs.
