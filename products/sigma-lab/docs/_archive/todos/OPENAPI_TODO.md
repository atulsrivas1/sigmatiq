OpenAPI Docs TODO (post-SDK)

- Add descriptions and examples for new flags and pagination fields across endpoints:
  - `/options_overlay`: include_underlying_parity, include_premium_parity, write_parity_csv
  - `/option_signals`: filters and pagination
  - `/audit`: filters and pagination
- Ensure consistent examples for `/signals`, `/leaderboard`, `/model_cards`, `/model_card`, `/policy/explain`, `/healthz`.
- Consider generating client stubs once SDK baseline is in place to validate contracts.
