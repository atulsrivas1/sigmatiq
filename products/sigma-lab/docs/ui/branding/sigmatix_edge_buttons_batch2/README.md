# Sigmatiq Sigma â€“ Batch 2: Buttons

This package contains theme-aware, accessible button components and a demo page.

## Quick Start
1. Open `preview/index.html` to test variants, sizes, icons, and theme/accent toggles.
2. Copy `components/buttons.css` to your project and include it after the token files.
3. Use the snippets in `components/buttons.html` or replicate the patterns in your framework.

> Requires the token files included in `tokens/` (already bundled here for convenience).
