# Pack Explorer â€” Themed Patch

This patch wires **sigma-pack-themes.css** into the Pack Explorer preview and adds a gradient hero with a global pack accent selector.

## Use
- Include `tokens/sigma-pack-themes.css` after your core tokens.
- Cards already carry `data-edge="<pack>"` and now pick up their own accent automatically.
- The page hero reflects the **global** accent (useful for area-wide theming).

Drop these files over the Batch 4 preview or use as a standalone demo.
