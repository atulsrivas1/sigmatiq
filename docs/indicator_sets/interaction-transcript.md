# Interaction Transcript — Engineers A & B (Indicator Sets)

Context: Engineers conduct a sets-focused exercise; each use case must involve 3–7 indicators working together. Single indicators are out of scope here.

Round 1 — Presentations

Engineer A
- Proposes: Momentum Breakout + Volume, Multi-TF Trend Alignment, Breakout Pullback, VPA Scanner, 0DTE Gate.
- Rationale: Clear economic intuition, broad demand, good compute characteristics.

Engineer B
- Proposes: Mean Reversion Bands + Oscillator, Volatility Expansion Regime, Options Premium Selector, Swing + Risk Controls, Regime Detection Hierarchy.
- Rationale: Complements momentum sets; covers risk/regime and options workflows.

Round 2 — Clarifying Questions
- A → B: “Options sets rely on IV data freshness — schedule?”
  - B: “Batch EOD with midday refresh optional; gate usage by data freshness.”
- B → A: “Multi-TF alignment — resampling rules?”
  - A: “Explicit TF per component; align to evaluation clock; no implicit mixing.”

Round 3 — Critiques
- A on B: “Premium selector risks lookahead if IV not synchronized with price.”
  - B: “We’ll include alignment QA and timestamp parity checks.”
- B on A: “VPA scanner could spam; how to control noise?”
  - A: “Debounce and min interval; distinct-until-changed; throttle WS.”

Round 4 — Roleplay Challenges
- Skeptical CTO: “P95 evaluate ≤ 1s across sets?”
  - A: “Compute-plan dedup + cache; show service SLOs and profiling.”
- Demanding Trader: “Template me — don’t make me wire params.”
  - B: “Publish curated presets with defaults and explanations.”
- Compliance: “Audit chain?”
  - A: “Resolved set JSON + SHA, component versions/timeframes, git sha stored.”
- DevOps: “Noisy neighbor risk?”
  - B: “Per-user quotas, universe caps, WS backpressure, cost estimator warnings.”

Round 5 — Convergence
- Phase 1: Momentum Breakout + Volume, 0DTE Gate, Multi-TF Trend Alignment.
- Guardrails: Redundancy/conflict detector; explicit TF; cost estimator; QA alignment.

Action Items
- Implement set validate/evaluate/backtest/subscribe endpoints.
- Build redundancy/conflict detection heuristics.
- Ship curated templates and rationale UI.
