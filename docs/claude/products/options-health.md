|--------|------|------------|------|
| **API** | <100ms | <500ms | >1000ms |
| **Database** | <50ms | <200ms | >500ms |
| **Backtest** | <5min | <10min | >15min |

### Data Quality

Coverage expectations:

| Data Type | Minimum | Target | Current |
|-----------|---------|--------|---------|
| **Stocks** | 95% | 99% | Usually 99.5% |
| **Options** | 90% | 95% | Usually 96% |
| **Historical** | 98% | 99.9% | Usually 99.8% |

### Queue Status

Normal ranges:

| Queue | Normal | Warning | Critical |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| **Pending** | 0-10 | 10-50 | >50 |
| **Wait time** | <1min | <5min | >10min |
| **Failed** | <1% | <5% | >10% |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "API Degraded"
**Impact**: Slower responses
**Action**: 
- Reduce request rate
- Use cached data
- Wait for resolution

#### "Database Slow"
**Impact**: Delays loading
**Action**:
- Avoid complex queries
- Use recent data only
- Try again later

#### "Market Data Delayed"
**Impact**: Old prices showing
**Action**:
- Don't trade live
- Wait for real-time
- Check broker feed

#### "Queue Backed Up"
**Impact**: Slow processing
**Action**:
- Cancel unnecessary jobs
- Priority items only
- Wait for clearing
