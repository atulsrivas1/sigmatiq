# Signals

## Live Trading Alerts and Monitoring

Signals are real-time trading recommendations generated by your models. This is where strategy meets action.

## What It Is

Signals are specific trading instructions that tell you:
- What to buy or sell
- When to do it
- How confident the model is
- Where to set stops

Think of signals as your trading assistant saying "Buy Apple stock now!"

## Why It Matters

Signals help you:
- Act on opportunities quickly
- Remove emotion from decisions
- Track model performance live
- Execute consistently
- Monitor multiple strategies

## Key Concepts

### Signal Components

Every signal includes:
- **Ticker**: What to trade (SPY, AAPL, etc.)
- **Side**: Direction (Buy/Long or Sell/Short)
- **Confidence**: How sure the model is (0-100%)
- **Timestamp**: When generated
- **Model**: Which strategy created it
- **Status**: New, filled, cancelled, expired

### Signal Types

|------|---------|--------|
| **Entry** | Start new position | Buy or short |
| **Exit** | Close position | Sell or cover |
| **Stop Loss** | Limit loss | Automatic exit |
| **Take Profit** | Lock gains | Partial/full exit |

### Confidence Levels
