# Feature Flags

## Control Which Features Are Available

Feature Flags let administrators turn features on or off for different users or groups without changing code.

## What It Is

Feature Flags are switches that control:
- Which features users can see
- Who gets new features first
- Testing experimental options
- Gradual feature rollouts
- Emergency feature shutdown

Think of them like light switches for features - flip on or off as needed.

## Why It Matters

Feature Flags help:
- Test new features safely
- Roll out gradually
- Customize by user type
- Fix problems quickly
- Control user experience

## Key Concepts

### Flag Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Release** | New feature rollout | "Enable new dashboard" |
| **Experiment** | A/B testing | "Show improved charts" |
| **Operational** | System control | "Enable maintenance mode" |
| **Permission** | User access | "Allow options trading" |

### Flag States

| State | Meaning | Who Sees |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **On** | Feature active | Everyone (or targeted group) |
| **Off** | Feature hidden | No one |
| **Partial** | Testing phase | Selected users only |

### Targeting Options

Flags can target:
- All users
- Specific users
- User groups
- Percentage rollout
- Geographic regions

## Typical Workflow

### Rolling Out New Feature

1. **Create Flag**
   - Name feature
   - Set to Off initially
   - Configure targeting

2. **Test Internally**
   - Enable for staff
   - Verify working
   - Fix issues

3. **Beta Release**
   - Enable for 5% users
   - Monitor feedback
   - Check metrics

4. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Increase to 25%
   - Then 50%
   - Then 100%

5. **Clean Up**
   - Remove flag eventually
   - Feature becomes permanent

### Emergency Shutdown

If feature causes problems:

1. **Identify Problem Flag**
   - Check recent changes
   - Find related feature

2. **Disable Immediately**
   - Toggle to Off
   - All users affected

3. **Investigate**
   - Review logs
   - Find root cause

4. **Fix and Re-enable**
   - Deploy fix
   - Turn back on carefully

## Targeting Strategies

### User-Based

Target specific users:
```
Users: user1@email.com, user2@email.com
Action: Enable feature
```

### Group-Based

Target user groups:
```
Group: Premium Users
Action: Enable feature
```

### Percentage Rollout

Gradual release:
```
Week 1: 10% of users
Week 2: 25% of users
Week 3: 50% of users
Week 4: 100% of users
```

### Conditional

Complex rules:
```
IF user.plan == "Premium"
AND user.country == "US"
AND user.account_age > 30 days
THEN enable feature
```

## Best Practices

### Do's ✓
- Test thoroughly before enabling
- Roll out gradually
- Monitor after changes
- Document purpose
- Clean up old flags

### Don'ts ✗
- Change multiple flags at once
- Skip testing phase
- Forget to document
- Leave unused flags
- Ignore user feedback

## Flag Management

### Creating Flags

Required information:
- Unique name
- Clear description
- Default state
- Target audience
- Rollback plan

### Monitoring Flags

Track metrics:
- Error rates
- Performance impact
- User engagement
- Feature usage
- Support tickets

### Retiring Flags

When to remove:
- Feature fully rolled out
- Feature cancelled
- No longer needed
- Code removed

## Impact on Users

### What Users See

**Feature On:**
- New buttons appear
- Extra menu items
- Additional options
- Enhanced functionality

**Feature Off:**
- Standard interface
- Basic options only
- No new elements
- Stable experience

### Communication

Inform users about:
- New features available
- Beta testing opportunities
- Temporary disabling
- Feature graduation

## Technical Details

### How Flags Work

Simple process:
1. User logs in
2. System checks flags
3. Determines what to show
4. Renders appropriate UI

### Performance Impact

Considerations:
- Minimal overhead
- Cached decisions
- Quick evaluation
- No user delay

### Flag Storage

Where stored:
- Database table
- Cache layer
- Configuration file
- Memory for speed

## Common Issues

### "Feature not showing"

Check:
- Flag enabled?
- User targeted?
- Cache cleared?
- Correct environment?

### "Feature disappeared"

Possible causes:
- Flag disabled
- Targeting changed
- Rollback occurred
- Error triggered

### "Wrong users seeing feature"

Verify:
- Targeting rules
- User groups correct
- Percentage accurate
- Conditions right

## A/B Testing

### Setting Up Tests

Create experiment:
1. Define variants (A and B)
2. Set 50/50 split
3. Choose success metric
4. Run for significance

### Measuring Results

Track metrics:
- Conversion rate
- User engagement
- Error frequency
- Performance

### Making Decisions

After testing:
- Review results
- Statistical significance?
- Choose winner
- Roll out to all

## Administrative Controls

### Permissions

Who can change flags:

| Role | Can Do |
|------|--------|
| **Admin** | Everything |
| **Manager** | View and toggle |
| **Developer** | Create and test |
| **User** | Nothing (just affected) |

### Audit Trail

All changes logged:
- Who made change
- What changed
- When changed
- Previous value
- Reason given

### Emergency Override

Admin powers:
- Kill switch for all flags
- Instant rollback
- Bypass targeting
- Force refresh

## Integration

### With Other Systems

Flags affect:
- User interface
- API responses
- Email communications
- Trading rules
- Risk limits

### External Tools

Integrate with:
- Analytics platforms
- Monitoring systems
- CI/CD pipelines

## Next Steps

For administrators:
1. Review current flags
2. Clean up unused ones
3. Plan new features
4. Set up experiments
5. Monitor impact

For users:
1. Check enabled features
2. Try beta options
3. Provide feedback
4. Report issues

## Assumptions & Open Questions

**Assumptions:**
- Admins understand impact
- Changes are reversible
- System handles gracefully

**Open Questions:**
- Self-service flags
- User opt-in/out
- Flag dependencies
- Automated testing
