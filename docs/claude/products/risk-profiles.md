# Risk Profiles

## Your Safety Settings for Trading

Risk Profiles are pre-set safety configurations that control how much risk your trading strategies can take.

## What It Is

A Risk Profile is a collection of rules that determines:
- How much money to risk per trade
- When to stop trading
- How many positions to hold
- What quality signals to accept

Think of it like the difficulty setting in a video game - Conservative is "Easy Mode" for safety.

## Why It Matters

Risk Profiles help you:
- Protect your capital from big losses
- Match trading to your comfort level
- Sleep better at night
- Avoid emotional decisions
- Stay within your limits

## Key Concepts
