# Sigmatiq Platform Vision Document

## Executive Summary

Sigmatiq is building the complete trading ecosystem that democratizes institutional-grade trading strategies for retail investors. Our platform transforms trading from guesswork into science through a systematic pipeline: **Create → Validate → Share → Automate**.

## Vision Statement

**To empower every investor with AI-driven trading systems that were once exclusive to Wall Street, making sophisticated trading accessible, transparent, and trustworthy.**
