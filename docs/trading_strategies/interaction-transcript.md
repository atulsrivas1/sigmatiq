# Interaction Transcript — Engineers A & B (Trading Strategies)

Round 1 — Proposals

Engineer A
- Focus: Momentum Breakout, Intraday VWAP Reversion, 0DTE Scalping, Trend Following.
- Rationale: Clear economics, broad appeal, showcases end-to-end engine.

Engineer B
- Focus: Iron Condor (IV Rank), Options Wheel, Pairs Trading, Sector Rotation.
- Rationale: Expands beyond equities; emphasizes risk and portfolio logic.

Round 2 — Critique
- A on B: Options need IV freshness and event handling; avoid lookahead.

  - A: Event-driven fills; spread/volume-aware slippage; parity dashboard.
- Compliance: “Audit every order.”
  - B: Persist config SHA, policy version, set version, and trade logs.
- DevOps: “Keep costs under control.”
  - A: Cache indicator outputs; parallelize folds/params; cap universes.

Round 3 — Convergence
- Phase 1: Breakout, VWAP Reversion, Trend Following, 0DTE.
- Requirements: Event-driven backtests, risk profiles, deployment pipeline.

Action Items
- Implement strategy CRUD/backtest/deploy APIs and artifacts.
