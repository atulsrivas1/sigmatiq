# Editorial Workflow for Workflows

States
- draft → in_review → published

Style
- Plain English, one idea per sentence, avoid jargon.
- Steps are imperative verbs; include rationale and an "expects" check.
- Include at least one link to an explainer (indicator/set/strategy).

Quality Gates
- Checklist completeness: title, subtitle, goal, persona, time, dependencies, steps, outputs, caveats.
- Readability and brevity: ≤ 8 steps; each step ≤ 2 sentences.
- Evidence: reference or internal note for why this works.

Versioning
- Bump content version on substantive change; keep change notes.
