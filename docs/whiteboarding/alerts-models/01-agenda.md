# Whiteboarding — Alerts Models (Novice-First)

Participants

Agenda (45–60 min)
- 0–5m: Re-state North Star and non-goals
- 5–15m: User outcomes and alert UX (beginner defaults)
- 15–30m: Data, features, labels, evaluation
- 30–45m: Guardrails, quotas, delivery cadence
- 45–60m: APIs, MVP scope, milestones, success criteria
 - Critic checkpoint (mandatory): call out risks, safer alternatives, and confirm plain-language defaults/undo.

Goals for this session
- Write crisp requirements a junior engineer can execute safely.
- Choose 2–3 starter recipes and alert budgets (per user per day).
- Lock the API touchpoints to Sigma Core for data/feature compute.
