# Feature Flags

## What it is

Feature flags are a way to turn features of our platform on and off for different users. This allows us to test new features with a small group of users before we release them to everyone.

## Why it matters

Feature flags are important because they help us to release new features safely. By testing new features with a small group of users, we can identify and fix any problems before they affect a large number of users.

## Key Concepts

*   **Feature Flag**: A switch that can be used to turn a feature on or off.
*   **User Segment**: A group of users that you want to target with a feature flag.

## Main Screen Tour

*   **Feature Flag List**: This section shows a list of all the feature flags in our platform.
*   **New Feature Flag Button**: This button allows you to create a new feature flag.
*   **Enable/Disable Switch**: This switch allows you to enable or disable a feature flag.
*   **Targeting Rules**: This section allows you to target a feature flag to specific user segments.

## Typical Workflow

1.  **Create a new feature flag**.
2.  **Give the feature flag a name and a description**.
3.  **Enable the feature flag**.
4.  **Target the feature flag** to a specific user segment.
5.  **Monitor the performance** of the feature and get feedback from users.
6.  **Release the feature** to everyone when you are confident that it is ready.

## Inputs & Outputs

*   **Inputs**: The Feature Flags page requires you to input the name, description, and targeting rules for your feature flags.
*   **Outputs**: The Feature Flags page displays a list of your feature flags and their status.

## Limits & Caveats
