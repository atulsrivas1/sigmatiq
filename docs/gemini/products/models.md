# Models

## What it is

The Models page is where you can create, manage, and backtest your trading models.

## Why it matters

The Models page is the heart of Sigma Lab. It is where you can turn your trading ideas into reality.

## Key Concepts

*   **Model**: A set of rules that tells our platform when to buy and sell a particular stock or asset.
*   **Backtest**: A simulation of how your trading model would have performed in the past.
*   **Template**: A pre-built trading model that you can use as a starting point for your own models.

## Main Screen Tour

*   **Model List**: This section shows a list of all your existing models.
*   **New Model Button**: This button allows you to create a new model.
*   **Backtest Button**: This button allows you to run a backtest on a selected model.
*   **Publish as Template Button**: This button allows you to publish a model as a template in the Sigma Market.

## Typical Workflow

1.  **Create a new model** from scratch or from a template.
2.  **Configure your model** by setting the parameters, such as the ticker, indicators, and risk profile.
3.  **Run a backtest** to see how your model would have performed in the past.
4.  **Analyze the results** of the backtest and make improvements to your model.
5.  **Publish your model as a template** to share it with the community.

## Inputs & Outputs

*   **Inputs**: The Models page requires you to input the parameters for your trading models.
*   **Outputs**: The Models page displays a list of your trading models and the results of your backtests.
