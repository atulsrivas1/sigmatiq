# Sigma Product Suite Overview

The Sigma Product Suite is a collection of tools that work together to help you trade smarter. Each tool is designed to perform a specific function, but they are all connected and share data with each other.

## The Modules

The Sigma Suite is made up of the following modules:

*   **Sigma Lab**: This is where you can create, test, and refine your trading ideas. It includes tools for building models, running backtests, and analyzing performance.
*   **Sigma Market**: A marketplace where you can discover and subscribe to trading strategies created by other users.
*   **Sigma Sim**: A realistic simulation of the stock market where you can practice trading without risking real money.
*   **Sigma Pilot**: A tool that can automatically execute your trades for you based on the strategies you have defined.

## How They Work Together

Here is a simple diagram showing how the different modules in the Sigma Suite are connected:

```

```

1.  You start by creating a trading model in **Sigma Lab**.
2.  You can then test your model in **Sigma Sim** to see how it performs in a realistic environment.
3.  Once you are confident in your model, you can use **Sigma Pilot** to automate your trades.
4.  You can also share your successful models with other users in the **Sigma Market**.
