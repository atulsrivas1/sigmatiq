# Create a Model

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a new trading model in Sigma Lab.

## What is a Model?

A trading model is a set of rules that tells our platform when to buy and sell a particular stock or asset. For example, a simple model might be: "Buy Apple stock when its price goes up by 2% in one day, and sell it when it goes down by 1%."

## Step 1: Go to the Models Page

From the main navigation menu, click on "Models". This will take you to the Models page, where you can see a list of all your existing models.

## Step 2: Click "New Model"

Click on the "New Model" button to start the model creation process.

## Step 3: Choose a Template

We provide a variety of templates to help you get started. Each template is designed for a specific type of trading strategy.

**Assumption:** The application provides a selection of pre-built model templates.

## Step 4: Configure Your Model

Once you have chosen a template, you can configure your model by setting the following parameters:

*   **Name**: A descriptive name for your model.
*   **Ticker**: The stock or asset you want to trade.
*   **Indicators**: The technical indicators you want to use to make trading decisions.
*   **Risk Profile**: The level of risk you are comfortable with.

## Step 5: Save Your Model

Once you are happy with your configuration, click "Save" to create your new model.

## Next Steps

Now that you have created a model, you can:

*   **Run a backtest** to see how it would have performed in the past.
*   **Deploy it to Sigma Sim** to test it in a realistic environment.
