# Run a Backtest

This guide will walk you through the process of running a backtest in Sigma Lab.

## What is a Backtest?

A backtest is a simulation of how your trading model would have performed in the past. We use historical market data to see how your model would have behaved and what the results would have been.

## Why is Backtesting Important?

Backtesting is important because it helps you to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your trading model. It can help you to identify potential problems and make improvements before you start using your model with real money.

## Step 1: Go to the Models Page

From the main navigation menu, click on "Models". This will take you to the Models page, where you can see a list of all your existing models.

## Step 2: Select a Model

Click on the model you want to backtest.

## Step 3: Click "Backtest"

Click on the "Backtest" button to start the backtesting process.

## Step 4: Configure Your Backtest

You can configure your backtest by setting the following parameters:

*   **Start Date**: The date you want to start the backtest from.
*   **End Date**: The date you want to end the backtest.

## Step 5: Run the Backtest

Click "Run" to start the backtest. This may take a few minutes to complete, depending on the complexity of your model and the length of the backtest period.

## Step 6: Analyze the Results

Once the backtest is complete, you will see a report with the results. The report will show you how much profit or loss your model would have made, as well as other important metrics such as the win rate and the maximum drawdown.
