# Validate Risk

This guide will walk you through the process of validating the risk of your trading model in Sigma Lab.

## What is Risk Validation?

Risk validation is the process of making sure that your trading model is not taking on too much risk. We provide a variety of tools to help you to understand and manage the risk of your models.

## Why is Risk Validation Important?

Risk validation is important because it helps you to protect your capital. By understanding the risks of your trading model, you can make sure that you are not taking on more risk than you are comfortable with.

## Step 1: Go to the Models Page

From the main navigation menu, click on "Models". This will take you to the Models page, where you can see a list of all your existing models.

## Step 2: Select a Model

Click on the model you want to validate.

## Step 3: Go to the Risk Profile Tab

Click on the "Risk Profile" tab to see the risk profile for your model.

## Step 4: Analyze the Risk Profile

The risk profile will show you a variety of metrics to help you to understand the risk of your model, such as:

*   **Maximum Drawdown**: The largest percentage loss that your model has experienced.
*   **Volatility**: A measure of how much the value of your model fluctuates over time.
*   **Sharpe Ratio**: A measure of how much return you are getting for the amount of risk you are taking.

## Step 5: Adjust Your Risk Profile

If you are not comfortable with the level of risk of your model, you can adjust your risk profile by changing the parameters of your model.
