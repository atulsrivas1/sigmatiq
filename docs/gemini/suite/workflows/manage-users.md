# Manage Users

This guide will walk you through the process of managing users in the Admin panel.

## What is User Management?

User management is the process of creating, editing, and deleting user accounts. It also includes managing user roles and permissions.

## Why is User Management Important?

User management is important because it helps you to control who has access to our platform and what they can do.

## Step 1: Go to the Admin Panel

From the main navigation menu, click on "Admin". This will take you to the Admin panel.

## Step 2: Go to the Users Page

Click on the "Users" tab to see a list of all the users in our platform.

## Step 3: Create a New User

To create a new user, click on the "New User" button and fill in the user's details.

## Step 4: Edit a User

To edit a user, click on the user in the list and make your changes.

## Step 5: Delete a User

To delete a user, click on the user in the list and then click on the "Delete" button.

## Step 6: Manage User Roles

You can also manage user roles and permissions from the Users page. For example, you can assign a user to the "Trader" role, which will give them permission to create and manage their own trading models.

**Assumption:** The platform has a role-based access control system with pre-defined roles.
