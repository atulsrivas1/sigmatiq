# Manage Feature Flags

This guide will walk you through the process of managing feature flags in the Admin panel.

## What are Feature Flags?

Feature flags are a way to turn features of our platform on and off for different users. This allows us to test new features with a small group of users before we release them to everyone.

## Why are Feature Flags Important?

Feature flags are important because they help us to release new features safely. By testing new features with a small group of users, we can identify and fix any problems before they affect a large number of users.

## Step 1: Go to the Admin Panel

From the main navigation menu, click on "Admin". This will take you to the Admin panel.

## Step 2: Go to the Feature Flags Page

Click on the "Feature Flags" tab to see a list of all the feature flags in our platform.

## Step 3: Enable or Disable a Feature Flag

To enable or disable a feature flag, simply click on the toggle switch next to the feature flag.

## Step 4: Target Specific Users

You can also target specific users with a feature flag. For example, you can enable a feature flag for all users in a certain country, or for all users who have signed up in the last week.

**Assumption:** The platform allows administrators to target feature flags to specific user segments.
