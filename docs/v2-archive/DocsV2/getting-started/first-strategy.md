**Wait time**: 1-2 minutes

## Step 5: Train Your Model

### Switch to Train Tab

Once building completes, click the **Train** tab.

### Training Configuration

#### Allowed Trading Hours
Default is market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- Keep default for stocks
- Can customize for futures/crypto

**Wait time**: 2-3 minutes

## Step 6: Run Your First Backtest

### Switch to Backtest Tab

After training completes, click **Backtest**.

### Backtest Settings

#### Test Period
Automatically set to out-of-sample data:
- Uses recent 6 months not seen in training
- Prevents overfitting (memorizing vs learning)

#### Capital Allocation
- **Starting Capital**: $10,000 (simulation)
- **Position Sizing**: According to risk profile
- **Commission**: $1 per trade (realistic)

#### Click "Run Backtest"

Watch the simulation:
- Trade entries and exits plotting
- Equity curve building
- Metrics calculating

**Wait time**: 1-2 minutes

## Step 7: Understand Your Results

### Performance Dashboard

Your results appear in several sections:

#### Summary Metrics

**Example Results** (yours will vary):
- **Total Return**: +12.3%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 1.45
- **Win Rate**: 58%
- **Total Trades**: 42
- **Max Drawdown**: -4.2%

#### What These Mean

**Total Return: +12.3%**
- Your $10,000 became $11,230
- Better than S&P 500 average (~10% annually)
- Remember: Past performance ‚â† future results

**Sharpe Ratio: 1.45**
- Risk-adjusted return measure
- Above 1.0 is good
- Yours shows solid risk/reward balance

**Win Rate: 58%**
- Won 24 trades, lost 18
- Above 50% is positive
- Quality matters more than quantity

**Max Drawdown: -4.2%**
- Largest loss from peak
- Under 5% is conservative
- Shows good risk management

### Equity Curve

The chart shows your account value over time:
- **Green line**: Your strategy
- **Gray line**: Buy and hold comparison
- **Red areas**: Drawdown periods

Look for:
- Steady upward trend
- Shallow drawdowns
- Consistent growth

### Trade Analysis

#### Trade Distribution
- **Long trades**: Buying expecting price rise
- **Short trades**: None (this strategy is long-only)
- **Average hold time**: 4.5 days
- **Best trade**: +3.2%
- **Worst trade**: -2.0% (stopped out)

#### Win/Loss Analysis
- **Average win**: +1.8%

### Running Your First Sweep

1. Click **Sweeps** in the navigation
2. Select your model
3. Choose **Conservative Sweep** preset

#### Sweep Configuration
- **Variations**: 9 (3x3 grid)
- **Parameters**: Threshold and hours
- **Estimated time**: 5-10 minutes

#### What Happens
The system will test combinations like:
- High confidence + morning trading
- Medium confidence + full day trading
- Low confidence + afternoon trading

### Understanding Sweep Results

You'll see a table with all variations:

| Config | Sharpe | Return | Trades | Gate |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|------|
| High/AM | 1.82 | 10.2% | 28 | ‚ùå |
| Med/Full | 1.45 | 12.3% | 42 | ‚úÖ |
| Low/PM | 0.91 | 8.7% | 61 | ‚úÖ |
