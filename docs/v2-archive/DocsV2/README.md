# Sigmatiq User Documentation

Welcome to Sigmatiq - your comprehensive trading platform that brings institutional-grade tools to retail investors. This documentation is written for traders, investors, and business users who want to understand and use the Sigmatiq platform effectively.

## What is Sigmatiq?
