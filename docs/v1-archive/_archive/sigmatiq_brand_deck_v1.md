# Sigmatiq — Brand Deck v1

**Essence:** Institutional discipline for retail traders.  
Lifecycle: **discover → validate → simulate → subscribe → automate → review**.

---

## Problem

- Retail traders get noisy signals and opaque bots.  
- Evaluation often lacks walk-forward rigor and real costs.  
- Automation without policy guardrails leads to avoidable drawdowns.

---

## Vision & Mission

**Vision**  
Level the playing field by packaging quant methods and AI into trustworthy tools anyone can use.

**Mission**  
Deliver measurable edge with transparent models, realistic testing, and controlled automation.

---

## Product Family

- **Sigma Lab** — authoring and evaluation.  
- **Sigma Sim** — broker-aware paper trading to validate before capital is at risk.  
- **Sigma Market** — curated feeds from AI and vetted human creators with disclosures.  
- **SigmaPilot** — policy-bound automation and position management.

---

## Lifecycle

1. Discover strategies that fit risk and capacity.  
2. Validate with strict backtests and walk-forward.  
3. Simulate with broker-aware fills.  
4. Subscribe to verified feeds.  
5. Automate under user policies.  
6. Review live vs. sim with attribution.

---

## Personas

- **Novice Retail Trader** — “Teach me and keep me safe.”  
- **Intermediate Self‑Directed** — “Let me customize and automate with limits.”  
- **Strategy Producer (Human or AI)** — “Publish, verify, monetize.”  
- **Compliance‑minded Investor** — “Enforce caps and audit trails.”

---

## Positioning

For retail traders and strategy creators who demand **governed execution** and **honest evaluation**, Sigmatiq provides **trustworthy signals** and **policy‑bound automation** across Sigma Lab, Sigma Sim, Sigma Market, and SigmaPilot. We compete on **validation quality**, **disclosures**, and **risk controls**.

---

## Values → Proof

- **Evidence over opinion** → model cards, provenance, expected ranges, out‑of‑sample gates.  
- **Transparency** → versioned cards, trade logs, slippage‑aware returns, change history.  
- **Risk first** → conservative defaults, loss caps, capacity controls, kill‑switch.  
- **Human control** → reversible automation, staged sim→live.  
- **Continuous learning** → forward tests, drift monitoring, attribution.

---

## Messaging Pillars

1. **Trust & transparency** — auditable history, disclosures, net‑of‑fees returns.  
2. **Governed automation** — policy engine, caps, cooldowns, kill‑switch.  
3. **Evaluation‑first** — parity sim↔live, walk‑forward, realistic costs.

---

## UX Principles

Clarity over cleverness. High contrast and accessible. Data‑dense with honest loading/empty/error states. Risk controls visible. Traceability one click away.

---

## Governance & Safety

- Model risk lifecycle and periodic re‑validation.  
- Provider vetting and change‑control audits.  
- Mandatory disclosures and capacity limits.  
- Defaults that prevent over‑risking.

---

## KPIs

Activation → first simulation.  
Sim → first live trade under caps.  
Share of strategies with positive out‑of‑sample.  
Live‑to‑sim variance and dispute rate trending down.

---

## Voice & Tone

Plain language. Numbers before adjectives. Risk statements upfront. No hype or return promises.

---

## Visual Direction (starter)

- Light/Dark modes, high contrast.  
- Accent per pack (e.g., ZeroSigma, SwingSigma).  
- Iconography: 24px stroke, grid‑consistent.  
- Tokens: color, radius, spacing, elevation for consistency.

---

## One‑liner

**Sigmatiq** turns data and AI into **trustworthy signals** and **policy‑bound automation** for retail traders and creators.
