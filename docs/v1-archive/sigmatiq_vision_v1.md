## ▪ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is SigmaLab?**  
A: SigmaLab is an AI intelligence platform featuring two types of models: Scanner Models that identify opportunities across entire markets, and Signal Models that generate specific investment alerts. Both can be accessed as pre-trained models or created custom using our visual interface.

**Q: How do Scanner and Signal models work together?**  
A: Scanner Models act as your first filter, scanning thousands of tickers to identify opportunities based on multiple indicators. Signal Models then provide deep analysis on those identified securities, generating specific actionable alerts with clear rationale.

**Q: Can I create my own Scanner and Signal models?**  
A: Yes! Our visual model builder lets you create both types without coding. Build custom scanners with your preferred indicators and criteria, then create signal models with your specific entry/exit logic.

**Q: How is this different from traditional screeners?**  
A: Traditional screeners use simple filters. Our Scanner Models use AI to identify complex patterns across multiple dimensions simultaneously, while Signal Models provide intelligent analysis beyond basic technical indicators.

**Q: Who should use SigmaLab?**  
A: Anyone who wants transparent AI for market analysis—from professional analysts needing explainable insights, to systematic investors wanting to codify their strategies, to researchers exploring market patterns.

**Q: Do I need to know machine learning to use SigmaLab?**  
A: No. While ML experts will appreciate the transparency and control, our visual model builder makes AI accessible to anyone who understands markets, regardless of technical background.
